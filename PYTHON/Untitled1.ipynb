The taste was good but it was a small salad and the $6 add on protein was super bland without much thought given to its preparation.My husband got the Caesar salad with an $8 salmon add on.

We were full and didn't have room for dessert, which also looked scrumptious!!!My only critique would be better curb appeal. When we walked in I thought maybe I'd made a mistake as the ambiance was lacking but the friendly staff and incredible food made that all a minor foot note. It wouldn't be costly to create an other worldly ambiance. Just some faux leaf trellis panels attached to the wooden 1/2 walls that are throughout and maybe some big ceramic pots and some kind of creative hanging animal art descending from the ceiling. Like hanging globe or wild birds from the ceiling. There's such a diverse culinary experience that creating an atmosphere that draws us in would make it all the more Stellar.

We started with the fried olives which were absolutely incredible. Such a great mixture of the saltiness of the fried olive, the creaminess of the ricotta and sweetness of honey. You can also make this dish vegan by substituting the honey for agave. Next we had the mushroom soy sausage pizza. All I can say is omg!!! It was so good. The crust was perfect, light and crispy without being burnt. It was to die for.

Both the waitress and the owner were very transparent about the composition of the dishes and where ingredients were sourced.For the food, we decided to share the koji butter steak and supplement the meal with more small plates (just make sure that if you want to order the steak, order it first to allot the chef at least 30 min to prepare it). We ordered the Hamachi Crudo, the scallops, and the stuffed chicken wings. The Hamachi crudo was super fresh and the quality of the fish was amazing. The stuffed chicken wings were also pretty good, but I think the next time I come here I'll try something different. On the other hand, the SCALLOPS, were delicious. I grew up vegetarian, and in the past few years, I've never quite warmed up to shellfish, scallops were something I've tried, but never liked. These scallops ended up being so delicious my partner and I ordered a second serving, and the chef was kind enough to add another scallop to our portion! The steak ended up being incredible, but the second most impressive thing was the coal-roasted Korean sweet potato side with some kind of Kimchi sauce. I would eat an entire plate of that, and my partner, who doesn't normally enjoy goguma, would 100% agree.Overall, Hibi was really great and it's been a while since I've had the chance to just sit down and enjoy nice Japanese/Korean food. I'll be coming again to try the miso butter elote and the octopus karaage!\",\n",

The food also took quite a while to come out, and there was quite a bit of wait between each dish being brought out. My favorite dishes from most to least favorite were the soy garlic wings, kimchi bacon udon carbonara, stir fried pork belly, and spicy cheese rice cake. The glaze on the wings was delicious, and the chicken was fried to perfection. The pasta had a unique flavor and was tasty. The stir fried pork belly was solid. For me personally, I'd prefer if the rice cake had a bit of other things in it, like ramen or even sausages. PSA: all the dishes are kind of on the smaller size, so don't expect to leave here feeling super full! They played Kpop on the TVs the entire time I was there, which kept me entertained as I waited for the food. For parking, we parked a few streets away and just walked over, which was not a big issue for us. Overall, a good spot with tasty food but there could be a bit of wait, especially on the weekend.\",\n",

I asked a server if we could order drinks and she responded rudely, \"I\\'m not your server, give me a few minutes\". 10 minutes passed and still no one came over, so naturally we left.

Not only does the space feel extremely spacious, the booths suck you in. The server was smooth and quick, grabbing our entire order to allow up the time to relax and enjoy the flow of courses. We had so much food it was really a lovely experience. Everything was coursed perfectly and the meal and wine we brought in were so complimentary. A 1970s Somera style Tempranillo and a 2018 CdP. We spent a little over three hours eating and laughing and with two corkage fees, three drinks, three glasses of wine, the seafood tower, two salads, three entrees and sides for days it was a modest $600 bill. I still think about this meal, so please don't let the price tag shock you, food that is this loved is a well deserved splurge.\",\n",

The interior is super cute and aesthetic, there's flies that come out towards the evening but they have fly swatters on the table. The food portion sizes are mid-size, to borderline small but enough to fill you up. I definitely recommend sharing family style so you can try everything on the menu! We had The kimchi bacon pasta and the bulgogi with a side ban Chan - the banchan was two dishes, radishes and kimchi, at $1.95. The bulgogi was sweet and good, as expected taste, and the kimchi bacon pasta was good as well. They didn't overdo it with the kimchi or bacon so it's easy to not taste either one if you are sharing. Overall the food was good, the service was good, the atmosphere was amazing and the interior design was amazing so it deserved up to four stars for that.

What was meant to be a memorable birthday dinner turned into a nightmare that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. The dishes were not only tasteless and poorly presented, It was as if the chef had taken a haphazard approach, tossing ingredients together without any thought or care. Every bite was a reminder of the money wasted on this dining experience. To make matters worse, instead of allowing us to enjoy our meal, the security guard seemed determined to rush us out of the restaurant. We were constantly interrupted and pressured to finish our plates, even though we had barely taken a few bites. It felt as if they were more interested in turning tables than ensuring customer satisfaction. As if this wasn't enough, the climax of this horrendous evening came when we were abruptly escorted out of the restaurant by security. It was my friend's birthday, and we had gathered to celebrate and enjoy a pleasant evening together. Which turned out to be one of the worst birthday celebrations.\",\n",

As you can tell it gives a variety of servings and the portion is large too. You can't go wrong with this order tho!The service is great. You order your food at the counter and they provide you a number. You seat yourself so I recommend someone order and someone holds down a table if you see one open because it does get busy. They have an intercom so you can listen for your number if you're sitting outside. You also self serve in termed of utensils, water, trash, etc. There are bins and trash can adjacent to the entry door so you can't miss it.Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and this location!\",\n",

We sat outside on the middle deck since there was another one above us and the ground floor was below. We were in a corner secluded which was nice since it was a date night. We were giving recommendations by the server on what food we should try based on our food likes. Let me say everything that came out was delicious!! We were both stuffed but the food was good we did not want to leave any so we ate more than we should've. They have a great drink menu and I went with the mad mango sour. More on the sour part but good nonetheless. For dessert we had the best cake you will ever have, that is the name of the cake and let me tell you it holds on to that name.

You eat, and then you get out. This is not one of those places you sit around and chat. So if that's the ambiance you are looking for, this is not it.I ordered the tongue and flank. Added lots of green onion and salt to my preference. It was delicious. However, you will not be so full that you would have to undo your pants button. I left with plenty of stomach space for dessert.

It was 4PM, they close at 9PM, and when I asked they told me there were only three parties ahead of me. I then asked if they mostly run on reservations, and they told me no that they also do stand by. So in the 15 minutes we waited while trying to figure out if it was worth it to wait and see how long it was going to be, we got a table. So I don't understand why we were told we might not get a table.Then they sat us in a booth that was way too small for five people. My group consisted of three smaller teenagers, if we were average sized people we would have fared worse. I asked if we could please sit somewhere else (there were several empty tables, and no one else was waiting), but I was told no.Then we were told that patrons usually order tapas style. So we all order something with the intention of sharing. This was a mistake, the entrees were way to small and we had to order more food. Again, my group had small people in it, so we don't normally eat a lot and we left hungry.Lastly, the bill was way too high. And on top of the overpriced food, there was an additional 18% gratuity charge that was added onto the bill. I'll never return to this place again. The hassle, the weird vibes, and the price is not worth it for just 'ok' pasta. There's better pasta to be had at better places.\",\n",

Don't miss the braised cabbage starter and the jerk duck main. All the food is well spiced and seasoned, and the chef even came out to check on us a time or two. Good bar service too. This is going to be a hot spot. Get in now while you can.\",\n",

       "  \"Gorgeous wine bar with great food!-- Atmosphere --The parking is a little tough during the weekdays / traffic hours but you can find meter parking by Shakeys and walk a block. You need to walk through a black gate that's generally closed to enter the venue. Trust me, the inside is beautiful.This place is great for 2-4 people, there are small round tables for smaller groups but there's also a lounge area for larger groups.They have wine fridges in the back with a friendly Sommelier, she was super helpful and attentive when I was picking out the wine.-- The Wine --They have a great selection of wine bottles and wine by the glass that range in different types (Sparkling, Orange, etc). Their wines range between $16-$18 by the glass, you can also get a bottle of wine to open (though there's corkage fee, this is standard).I ordered their sparkling on the menu and it was delicious, super refreshing and super unique, it was a natural wine. Everyone else at my table was pretty happy with their selections as well.-- The Food --The menu there is made for shared / family style. We ordered:- 3 Appetizers to start, they were all very delicious but the memorable ones were theCrudo with Cherries (it wasn't fishy at all, the sweetness & crunch toppings really made this special)Burrata with Tomatoes (the burrata was fluffy and a completely different texture than what I'm used to, and it was absolutely amazing. It was lightly sweetened with honey & balsamic, and the tomatoes they used were to die for).- For the greens, we ordered the Zucchini and while it was delicious, I wished we also had ordered the Little Gem Salad. If you're a veggie eater, I would recommend ordering more here- For the main, we got a single dish of the mushroom pasta. It definitely was not filling for 4 people and we should've gotten at least another 1-2 mains.Overall, it was a great experience, food was great but you'd need to order a lot to really get full. Wine selection is amazing.\",\n",

The dishes come with rice, a few kimchi side dishes, and some soup. We also got steamed egg but its super small so i would pass on that.First off the uni was my favorite but maybe since its not in season / just starting it wasn't that fresh. I think they definitely try to mask it with quail egg and a lot of seasame oil. I really did like this dish but do wish they used better quality uni itself. The crab- honestly was a bit of a let down. I didn't really like the marinate it lacked flavor compared to the soy marinated crabs im used to.

I would have loved more sauces as it was a bit dry, and wish some thicker dipping sauce came along for the tofu. But otherwise quite enjoyable. The tofu was nicely crisped and fried but not too oily. The portion was quite big too, and I took half home for next day's lunch!Service here is great, very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in assisting with dietary restrictions. It's a bit cramped inside, but we came around 2pm when the place was beginning to clear out. I'd hate to come during a busy hour.\",\n",

       "  'First and foremost to Jordan Kahn for a remarkable meal. We visited for the Cos wine paired dinner. I appreciated the molecular gastronomy very much, the well balanced dishes, all presented beautifully. It would have been five stars if not for the snarky staff.The decor was interesting, created a dark, intriguiging mood. The tableware was original and fun.All of our servers were great, but could have been more detailed with the very original, and unique dishes, how they were prepared, what techniques, and the background of the unusual products. However, the host/floor manager who came by a couple of times was rude, snippy, unprofessional, and unpleasant considering we each paid over $200 per plate for the evening. The place was quite empty. We asked to be moved to the patio to have a bit more peace as the music was loud with a driving beat. He said the music would soften, but it did not. He refused to bring it down a notch. We could barely focus on the food. The answer was a curt \"no\", with no reasoning whatsoever.My dining partner asked for a bit more wine with the first tasting. We had driven 90 minutes to the restaurant on a busy night and she wanted to relax. The host or floor manager\\'s reply was a snippy, \"You\\'ll get your 3 glasses in. No. We can\\'t serve you any more of the tasting wine.\" \\xa0Such rudeness and assumption we were there for 3 glasses of wine? Seriously?The final issue were the restrooms. One was unusable as some male had missed the toilet altogether and the floor was a puddle of personal \"liquid\" and the other toilet was clogged. Co-gender restrooms may be \"in\", but again, when you\\'ve planned for a nice evening out, visiting a smelly or messy restroom is just disgusting.We won\\'t be going back. The food was quite good, but the experience of the loud pounding music, the host/floor manager\\'s attitude, brought for a pretty unplesant evening altogether, and for $200+ per person, it\\'s highway robbery.',\n",

They seem to expect tip above that...Always feels wrong and greedy to put the burden on patrons to pay for wages when we are already spending so much money on the food/ supporting the business.As for food, I tried the menchi katsu, amberjack sashimi, prawns, eggplant tempura, and half dozen oysters. My favorites were the katsu, prawns, and tempura. Servings were very small (small plates) but all of these were tasty and had great textures and balance of flavors. I would probably skip the oyster because it was nothing special for the price and they serve it with a basic boring ponzu dressing.We had to wait about an hour to be seated and I think that is usually expected. A lot of people come here for the alcohol offerings and there were tables that were there for the entire 3 hours that I waited and ate. They don't make much of an effort to turn tables if you are ordering alcohol consistently but we did feel pressured to leave as soon as we stopped ordering drinks. They also started rushing our food orders out about this time too.Parking is quite difficult in this area, heads up.\",\n",

Lettuce leaves, hot peppers and ssamjang in the refrigerator. On the hot bar, they have Spicy pork with baby octopus, a spicy yam dish, fried mackerel, Korean pancake, sundubu tofu, a fluffy egg dish along with a couple other dishes I think I've missed. The cold bar had spicy crab, bean sprouts, japchae, daikon/carrots and a very nice variety of banchan. There was more that I can't remember but it was all delicious!If you're looking for super authentic homemade Korean food, this is a fantastic new option.

The quality and the consistency of the tenderness with an equally distributed spice level with every bite wowed us. The cheese and bacon were decent ratios with the tenders. The slaw was slightly sweet and not too soggy. The fries were crispy despite the 20-minute commute it took to be delivered to my apartment. The aioli was delicious as well.I think this would have been a different experience had I tried the food while dining out rather than getting it delivered. This was good, the quality was great and I would be up for trying it again.\",\n",

Smell can be tough to handle if you are not used to old school traditional Korean food, but I personally really enjoyed it. Service was also great too. They have a button on the table that you can press whenever you need something.I think the highlight was their muk gul lee, which is traditional Korean rice wine. It came in like a stone jar and it tasted very delicious. They must brew their own because it didn't taste like those cheap commercial ones.Overall, I think this spot is a great option if you want to just chill, eat, and drink with friends and family.

I am honestly disappointed that this did not live up to the high ratings I have seen on Yelp and Google reviews.I ordered the pork pan fried pork buns, wok tossed eggplant and basil, and beef roll. The pan fried pork buns were not as juicy as other ones I've tried. I was expecting a lot of hot soup to pour out as a I nibble a piece of the dumpling. The wok tossed eggplant and basil dish was a bit better. It was some good flavors, but I can tell that the eggplant was not soaked enough longer to absorb flavors. Some aspects of the eggplant was blander than other parts. The beef roll was actually the one I was most excited for because I have been craving for it. It was the worse ones I've tried because there is a high cucumber to beef ratio so it felt more like a cucumber roll than a beef roll.The service is pretty good and the ambiance of the place is just like any DTLA establishment. I like the concept that you should order and pay first, especially when going with a large group! It saves a lot of mental math but honestly, with the food not living up to my expectations, it really made me feel disappointed.\",\n",

The location has a cool concept with multiple dining rooms. We sat on the side that would be considered, possibly more family style oriented based off of the color scheme in the larger tables. The other dining area may be geared more towards more of a outside ambience starlight Ambience the way that it is designed.

Light and crispy, massive, veggies cooked perfectly, and it came with two hot sauces - the verde one was unreal.My partner got Huevos a la Mexicana which he loved, and I got one of each of the Chipotle and Mole hibiscus tacos (vegan!).

I went about a month ago and then 2 days ago thinking that maybe a month ago they were just having a bad rush day but when I went 2 days ago, it was just as bad. I don't know if they changed the cooks or if it was busy so they didn't really focus on timing but it was not good at all. I got the salmon and shrimp plate. My salmon was beyond dry, ridiculously dry. I could tell as soon as I opened the container. The salmon was hard in certain pieces, it wasn't burnt but very very over cooked. The plating was very nice but it was difficult to eat the salmon because of the dryness and hard pieces. I've never had this issue except for the last 2xs that I visited here. And I always get the same thing and both times I was very disappointed.It's disheartening because I spend $100 there easily every time I go and I expect to get quality food for spending that amount every time. My husband and son also got a plate but chicken and steak. The chicken was just as dry as the salmon.I'm unclear what's going on the last few visits but I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. There are a few Hibachi restaurants around so I may have to try another spot from here on.I would recommend maybe try something small first instead of getting a plate because you don't want to spend a lot of money on something that's not cooked to perfection.\",\n",

There are different rooms in this place, but they were only seating everyone in the room with the movie-theme.We ordered two plates: the chicken gizzard and the spicy intestines. Both were great however I was hoping that there would be slightly more gizzard and intestines in each dish compared to ratio of the onions, garlic, etc.I was also a bit bummed that they did not have chili paste at all. They did have sriracha and gochujang so that sufficed.Our server was nice, but at some point he started eating with his other colleague and so flagging him down for the check in the end was a bit harder.Overall, a relatively decent option in the east end of Ktown! Parking was ok for us because it was a Monday night and pretty late, but the lot was still like 90% full, so I can't imagine how the situation would be on a weekend night.\",\n",

We got there for our reservation a bit late, so we hung out at the bar until our table was ready. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful. It was elevated Vietnamese design. Every corner was a photo spot. We got the tropic thunder, Nha trang beach club and Nguy·ªÖn in Rome. Surprisingly the Nguy·ªÖn in Rome was our favorite drink. It looked to be the strongest but was actually the sweetest. Tropic thunder and nha trang beach club were a little bit too sour in our opinion and we were expecting a more milky or refreshing taste. We ordered the tiger prawns, bo luc lac, banh xeo, lobster curry, and Vietnamese coffee creme br√ªl√©e. All the food was delicious and full of flavor. The tiger prawns were good and in a sweet sauce. The bo luc lac was really delicious. The meat was very nicely marinaded and the beef was cooked perfectly. It was served on a bed of greens that was also very good and light. The banh xeo was very crispy almost like a taco. The lobster curry was the star of the show and served with delicious flavored rice. The creme br√ªl√©e was good but it would've been even better cold. Overall, would definitely visit the restaurant again to try the snapper or sea bass since they were out of the snapper. A perfect date or girls night place. Staff and service was amazing!\",\n",

But prices were high relative to the quality.Cocktails and wine were good but overpriced.Also, they charged an extra 5% fee, supposedly for their workers, but I checked their website afterwards, and it's clear that the fee is going to the restaurant, not directly to employees. I felt that this was incredibly deceptive. Moreover, I did not even know about the fee until we got the check. Apparently it was somewhere on the menu (which I did not see when ordering), but who reads all the fine print on a menu?

The restaurant had an overwhelmingly unpleasant \\'fishy\\' smell as soon as we walked in, like spoiled seafood, and the vast majority of the restaurant was empty. We were seated immediately in a booth and brought water but it took awhile to get menus and drinks. The server was friendly but he NEVER came back--- we were left on our own for SO LONG without anyone coming by to see how we were doing. He told us to use the QR code for accurate pricing since the menus they gave us were not up to date (then why give them to us at all?). I ordered fried tofu and asked for a side of peanut sauce instead of sweet chili, and my friend ordered pad see ew and some mango sticky rice for dessert. Our food took maybe 20 minutes to come out. The food was hot and fresh, the tofu perfectly crisp on the outside, but it was VERY mushy and soggy on the inside, like too much water was left in it maybe? And extremely bland, no flavor whatsoever. Even when I dipped it in the peanut sauce that just tasted like peanut butter, no seasoning or heat in the sauce at all. \\xa0It was like eating spongy cardboard with a mushy center. My friend said her food was good but honestly, we were astonished by the service. We sat down to eat at 9:15. We finished eating around 10 and waited for the server to come by to offer us to-go boxes and bring the check. We sat and talked, our plates obviously finished, no longer eating, until 10:40 when I finally flagged him over to bring us to-go boxes and the checks. He brought the to-go boxes and then vanished again. We boxed up our leftovers and waited, but no check arrived. At almost 11 he resurfaced and I flagged him down again and asked for the checks again. He said \"Oh, no one brought them to you? Sorry!\" and went to get the card machine and brought it to us. The food is a little pricey - my appetizer of fried tofu was $20 plus tip and the mandatory fee for using a debit card (we actually used Apple Pay) and while the portion size was generous I can\\'t say the flavor or the service is going to make us come back. I know there\\'s better food in Thai Town.',\n",

       "  'Dined here on Sunday (8/27) at 6:30PM.I rarely leave yelp reviews, but dining at this place was incredibly sensational and emotional I had to publicize my experience. I started seeing accounts on Instagram rave about the smoked trout dip and I\\'d like every photo of their Sicilian crudo that would show up on my feed. Needless to say, this place was bookmarked. I currently reside in Marina del Rey and avoid driving to the east side at all costs, but I decided to suck it up and make that 45 minute drive over. I had no idea what I was in for. We got to dine outside, which suited the seafood feast we had. It was near sunset so the golden hour was alive and well. Our servers were so passionate and informed about the menu items, that we had full confidence and excitement in everything we ordered.Melon De Burgogne ($58) - Bright, crisp, refreshing! We were able to order and enjoy this wine while waiting for our table. Drink with oysters and sunshine!Overboard Platter ($161) - \"Life\\'s short, get the seafood platter!\" was the statement of the evening. Jaws were on the floor when this tower was placed on our table. 18 of the freshest oysters imaginable, peel & eat prawns that packed a punch of flavor, the buttery, melt in your mouth, delectable Sicilian crudo, and a crab cocktail dip that was so meaty, LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!Smoked Trout Dip ($23) - The first bite of this brought tears to my eyes. I have never tasted anything like it, I still don\\'t know how to explain the flavor. They made something so simple have so much depth and complexity. A ritz cracker was the perfect vessel for this delicious dip.Bub & Grandma\\'s Bread ($8) + White Anchovies ($5) - That bread was the main character! She was so buttery and the perfect ratio of toasted layer to soft warm bread. The anchovies were also very necessary. It elevated a simple bread and butter starter to an entr√©e level menu item.Scallop Tostada ($19) - I could have eaten 3 of these. Strong yuzu and basil flavors were the ideal companion to the rich taste of this mollusk legend. A must order.Lobster Bisque Roll ($33) - How are you going to go to a seafood forward establishment and not get their signature lobster roll? it\\'s impossible. But boy oh boy, no regrets whatsoever. They did not skimp on the lobster and the bun was so light, soft, and buttery. It was perfect.Fried Cod Sandwich ($17) - We couldn\\'t not try their seasonal special. C\\'mon. Amazing quality fish, fried with a thin crispy layer of batter. The sauce. Not sure if it\\'s tartar or some sort of aioli (I forgot), but it complimented the fish perfectly. They made a fried fish sandwich refreshing with some tang. So simple, so delicious.',\n",

We sincerely asked her if that option can be replace with other menu since only bones are left and she said \"I can\\'t because I already put this food (several pieces of bones) on the dinner box and that can\\'t be replace with other menu option.\"We were just appalled by her response and decided to walk out the restaurant.Isn\\'t it common sense that if there are no meat and only bones are left, staff needs to take it off from food menu and inform customer that it\\'s sold out and have them select different entree.If that selection was a fish entree, I bet she would give me fish bones and would tell me that she can\\'t take it off because I chose that option and once that bones are put it into the dinner box, you can\\'t take it off nor replace with other menu.I am just really upset how this ignorant and imprudently trained staff could treat customer with this type manner. We are paying for not only good food but service as well.How are some of these Elite Yelp reviewers gave this place five stars.To restaurant owner or staff manager:I stopped by your restaurant at 7/7/24 Friday at 6:00pm. This staff needs to be addressed and retrained. Customers are not stupid. We are going to your place expecting good food and decent service.

Parking in the structure was easy and they validate it- don't forget because parking is $$$Bottom line, happy hour here is a great way to try out their top picks of the menu, but be warned that the portions are really small!
