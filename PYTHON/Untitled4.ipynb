       "   \"Came here before pantages and what a unique find. You can tell the chef trying to be unique and trying to do things just a bit different. \\xa0The warmth and hospitality were wonderful. We ordered a variety of dishes Including Arugala tostada (tasted like a delicious avocado toast), corn tostada (ok), potatoes (yummy but could be crispier), pork belly (deliciously charred), beet quesadilla (wow...who would have guessed), baked Brie (oh my!), and the crème brûlée (very good). The only thing that disappointed me was the pavlova. \\xa0One of my ultimate favorite desserts. \\xa0I loved \\xa0the effort to be unique. It was a deconstructed pavlova with ice cream. \\xa0It seemed to be more ice cream than anything and The fruit was very tart. So one bite was \\xa0super sweet and the next was so tart my mouth and face literally puckered. \\xa0The back patio was quaint and a fun find tucked in Hollywood. \\xa0The owner was super sweet making sure everything was ok, telling us to walk to pantages bc parking was cheaper. \\xa0This felt much more like a European cafe \\xa0where you asked for a check and you can sit and talk to friends all night. \\xa0Or even going over to his house for a bbq. \\xa0We weren't rushed in anyway. \\xa0Would recommend trying.\",\n",

His reaction was rude, apathetic, and snobby. If he would've answered empathetically we probably would have stayed, but the attitude definitely made us loose our appetite. I felt like he was doing a favor letting us sit at his restaurant. Everyone in the restaurant looked like they were sitting in a sauna. For a nice expensive meal, I don't want to drip all over the table and be talked down to, thank you.\"]}}"
