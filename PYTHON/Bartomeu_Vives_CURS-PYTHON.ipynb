Lettuce leaves, hot peppers and ssamjang in the refrigerator. On the hot bar, they have Spicy pork with baby octopus, a spicy yam dish, fried mackerel, Korean pancake, sundubu tofu, a fluffy egg dish along with a couple other dishes I think I've missed. The cold bar had spicy crab, bean sprouts, japchae, daikon/carrots and a very nice variety of banchan.

And they certainly did not. Everything at this place was done tastefully and elegantly. The entry way is beautifully lit with terracotta lanterns and the terrace has a beautiful classy yet warm vibe to it. This place screams pretentious but it is surprisingly not - wait staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. Now the food. Everything on the menu sounded appetizing and since there was only two of us, we couldn\\'t order too many different things. We were torn between ordering a few items to get a feel of the flavors or ordering the whole fish and just enjoying it. We went for the whole fish and we were glad we didn\\'t order anything along with it. The rockfish arrived in a tasteful stainless steel platter, and was filleted in the kitchen and sliced in the platter without losing its \"whole fish\" look. It sat on a bed of a medley of fresh salad veggies that maintained their crisp consistency despite sitting under a hot fish. Aka. They were not soggy. The seasoning of the fish was perfect, and the herbs mixed in with the spring veggies really lifted the flavors and made everything taste so light, smooth and fresh, while maintaining some richness thanks to the boldness of the olive oil in the sauce/dressing. I would highly recommend trying this place out. I\\'ll definitely be back to taste more of this gorgeous menu!'}, {'data': '2023-05-27', 'data_carrega': '2023-09-17', 'cos': 'This place is so beautiful. The vibe, service, decor, food and drinks.

Nice, clean, minimalistic/newtro aesthetic. It was also nice seeing the chefs working behind the counter rather than hidden in the back. Guy at the counter was super nice. Ordered our food, took our table number card, and found a seat immediately. It was busy but not packed. There\\'s some nice big tables in the center of the dining area which could comfortably seat 6 maybe crush in 8, and some smaller tables on the perimeter. I sat on the side that had the long bench with white stools on the other side of the table. I don\\'t recommend the white stools, my butt went numb after a while, try getting the other seats with the nicer chairs especially if you\\'re a bigger person like me.Despite the discomfort of the stool, this place gets 5 stars because the food is amazing. We had an order of three Braised Pork Belly over rice, Chiayi Chicken Rice, Egg Tart, Hong Kong Milk Tea, and later a free Pineapple Bread.Chiayi Chicken Rice was nicely seasoned. As the seasoning soaked into the rice it gave it a partial congee texture which made the meal feel very cozy (I may get this on sick days from now on). The spicy pickled radish it came with gave it a nice contrast. Add the chili sauce to every spoonful of chicken rice and it was perfection.The Braised Pork Belly over rice came a little late which is why we got our free Bread but it was worth the wait (also not docking points because it is a soft opening after all and they\\'re figuring this stuff out). Once again the seasoning was key, and the cucumber pickle perfectly cuts the greasiness of the Pork Belly. I wouldn\\'t advise everyone at the table getting this together though. My wife and I shared half and thought it would have been a bit overwhelming to deal with if one of us had our own bowl.Egg Tart was so good. It was a more custardy egg tart. Wife says the texture reminds her of a soft serve. Perfectly flaky on the outside. A+Pineapple bun... mm...mmm... chef\\'s kiss. So soft out on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. They gave us butter with the bread but honestly didn\\'t need it. \\xa0Now I\\'m glad our Pork Belly dish came out late cuz I would\\'ve missed put on my new favorite Pineapple bread.'}, {'data': '2023-08-31', 'data_carrega': '2023-09-17', 'cos': \"I'm going to be the first customer here!!!

I feel like the idea of the complementary bread is wonderful but the bread itself isn't great. What is great is if your dining pal is ordering something with pink sauce... and then you can save the bread for the pink sauce but other than that, the bread is a big MEH and could totally step it up.Our waiter was from Italy - we thought this was wonderful! However... he interrupted my wife a few times and was actually kind of rude to her. Wasn't the coolest thing I experienced... he was attentive to our party but the rudeness was a little off-putting.The prices for the dish are very high considering the portions are on the smaller side. I had the salmon... it was cooked perfect but I felt like when I read the menu I was receiving something on the side vs just a tomato salad. For some reason, I interpreted this as a salmon with a tomato salad and a spinach salad. Turns out there were pieces of the spinach on top of the salmon - but it wasn't phrased as a sauce/or that it would be a salmon flavor addition.As I looked around, it seemed everyone's portion was small... which is fine (I suppose even more fine for fine dining) but for the prices, it just didn't seem worth it. I think my wife had like 20 small gnocchi's... my pal had 5 ravioli's and the lasagna was just TOO CHEESY.It was a bit warm inside the restaurant - and they have these lamps on the tables instead of lighting the restaurant with the restaurant's lighting. I feel like the lamps got in the way and some tables had cool lighting... some had warm lighting... it was an odd touch.Bathrooms need an update - the decor looks very out of place and there was a Christmas decoration. Why? No clue.I enjoyed the food - the tastes were delicious but for overall experience I am really a 3 star teetering a 4 star. We were all hungry after! And for a salmon for $38, I really didn't anticipate being hungry after but I am glad to have found a new restaurant... that is always the highlight.\"}, {'data': '2023-08-14', 'data_carrega': '2023-09-17', 'cos': \"This is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. I have been dining here for 15 years now. The decor is simple and understated with generational photos of the family that run the restaurant. Ask your server to point out who is who and hear the history of this incredible, hard working family. Chances are the young ones in the photos have grown up and taken a role in the operation of this family gem.On to the food...The menu has grown over the years adding dishes that are a bit more contemporary while also keeping the original items too. For starters they recently added an Arancini dish loaded with saffron infused arborio rice and short rib. It is super crispy on the outside and beautifully decadent on the inside. The dish is accompanied by three incredible sauces to soak up. Additionally I have always loved their Frittura Mista and the Polipozzo to start with. The salads are beautiful and fresh and delicious.The Pasta is on another level here. All of these dishes will make you feel like the namesake Momma still prepares them herself, may she RIP. My favorite is the Tonnarelli alla Carbonara, the sauce is thick and creamy yet delicate and the guanciale is cooked to a crispness that just makes it pop in your mouth. Another favorite is the Bigolo all'Amatriciana, the pasta is thick and filled with a beautiful texture and the guanciale is mouth watering in the san marzano tomatoes it is cooked down with.For mains we have always enjoyed the Bisteconna and the Il Branza, both of which always come out perfectly cooked and leaving us wanting more, which is hard because these dishes are large and worth sharing.Now I am no wine aficionado, however the wine menu is incredible. They feature mainly Italian wines with a BOOK that gives the region the grapes were grown and define's each areas practices and tastes. It's a history lesson of wine really. Do not let this intimidate you. The servers know each wine almost by heart and can tell you, based on your likes or dislikes, which will best suit you. They are currently offering a $20 wine flight that is unbeatable. Do not pass on it!I truly love this place so much and am so happy this family has kept their Momma's traditions alive.

Reservations are a must, and while the dress code is casual, you will find people dressing in more semi-formal attire. Please note that parking can be a tad bit challenging as there are mainly street parking spots.To start off, the exceptional service immediately caught my attention. The staff create personalized and more meaningful interactions with diners. They worked in a fast pace but not in a way where we felt rushed to eat our meal. They were very attentive as they were always quick to refill our waters and collect any empty dishes and trash. They offered plenty of help with describing the menu the moment you sit down. They also add to the Italian restaurant's ambiance by speaking Italian here and there.I cannot stress enough how amazingly fresh the food was. You will first be asked if you want to start off with an appetizer called Homemade Bread & Evoo for $3. You can clearly taste how freshly made the bread is. Everything came out fresh and at a pretty decent pace. We also ordered 2 pizzas to share, and considering we were a party of 4, the waiter knew to ask if we wanted our pizzas to be sliced into 8 instead of the standard 6. Without a doubt, I would definitely return to this location. Every item we ordered was so warm and fresh.\"}, {'data': '2023-09-11', 'data_carrega': '2023-09-17', 'cos': \"Excellent food.

My personal favorite was the White Lightning pizza which I absolutely loved and had I not eaten it so quickly, I would\\'ve shared a picture of it.

It wasn\\'t so petite when my friend decided to order more and ended up eating 16 cookies in 20 minutes. If ricotta cookies are your thing, I\\'d be sure to call ahead to make sure JnVs has enough ricotta cookies available as we happened to catch them on a lucky day.The last part, which I really want to emphasize is how great the service is.

So I don't understand why we were told we might not get a table.Then they sat us in a booth that was way too small for five people. My group consisted of three smaller teenagers, if we were average sized people we would have fared worse. I asked if we could please sit somewhere else (there were several empty tables, and no one else was waiting), but I was told no.Then we were told that patrons usually order tapas style. So we all order something with the intention of sharing. This was a mistake, the entrees were way to small and we had to order more food. Again, my group had small people in it, so we don't normally eat a lot and we left hungry.Lastly, the bill was way too high. And on top of the overpriced food, there was an additional 18% gratuity charge that was added onto the bill. I'll never return to this place again.

The Elderflower Tonic was a little too spirit-forward for me, but I loved the sweet Blue Coconut Margarita and the Yo-Berry which tasted like an adult Danimals in the best way!Crispy Crab and Spicy Tuna: Unique twist on spicy tuna crispy rice but with a crab cake instead of the rice. Well spiced, huge pieces, super delicious.K-Taco Trio: The bulgogi taco was my favorite, would recommend this!Seafood Cioppino Pasta: Pretty average execution of this dish, but loved the fried crab on top.Kim's Kimchi Pasta: My favorite of the mains, spicy and flavorful, but wish there was more bacon.Born to Be Beef and Cheese: I was the most excited for this one going in. Really cool presentation, delicious sauce and potatoes, loved the tableside cheese brûlée and KBBQ-inspired flavors. The fondue could've been creamier and meat could've been more tender, but overall I enjoyed this!Cheesecake: Our slice wasn't fully defrosted when it was served to us, so the inside was still a bit frozen.

Place was fully booked. We were promptly seated and our order was taken within 5 minutes. So far so good. But that was the end of the quality experience.We ordered a blue beach and a cocktail. The blue beach (given it\\'s a soda mixed drink) foamed so much it caused a mess on the table. We had zero napkins and tried to flag a server (there were only 3 working) down for about 10 minutes before giving up and just getting up to grab our own. We ordered the spicy pork lettuce cups and the korean fried chicken to split. We got our lettuce cups about 15-20 minutes in. Not bad, just fine, nothing special about it.As my friend and I talk, I notice the general vibe of the restaurant. Many tables were either being ignored or missing items. The table next to us (who was there before we sat down) got one dish (the avocado toast) and seemed to be waiting on other items. From the time I started noticing them, they tried to flag the server to ask about the other dishes (they were told they were on the way) but never came out. The family eventually left 15-20 minutes later, just paying for the avocado toast and left. A while later, a couple came and sat at the table behind that one and waited for I\\'d say a good 10-15 minutes before their orders were taken (and they looked ready to order: they weren\\'t looking at the menus, they kept trying to eye the waiters). I saw food being brought out to tables but items either going back (as the order was wrong/for another table) or people asking about other items. I noticed a pattern with the dishes being brought out: Fries, avocado toast, panini sandwiches, and seafood spaghetti. I didn\\'t see any other dishes being brought out and weirdly those are also items I am not seeing in any of the review photos or mentioned in reviews except for if the restaurant or a soft opening review posted them. The table behind us had arrived at the same time, received their seafood pasta a little after we had received the cups, and I overheard them ask how much longer for the Donkatsu.At this point, mind you, my friend and I have been chatting this whole time. We\\'ve been done with our drinks and appetizer for a good 30-60 minutes now but are wanting to 1) order more drinks and 2) now feeling distracted enough in our conversation to realize we\\'re missing our main dish. We are trying to flag down a server to order more drinks and ask about our order. The table behind us is also trying to flag down a waiter and we smile at each other in acknowledgement about how difficult it is to get their attention. I have never been at a restaurant where the servers actively look the other way. Like they were trying everything they could do not meet our gaze. My friend and I were now realizing we had sat there 1 whole hour without getting our second dish, had noticed the above behavior and patterns mentioned, and realized we\\'re in Ktown, there are sooooo many other places around us with good KFC if that\\'s what we want. So I end up just getting up and going to the bar to ask for a receipt for the items we received and mentioned we never got our fried chicken. The table behind us also gets up to ask for to-go boxes for the pasta and a check for just the pasta and drinks, no donkatsu. We end up leaving and going to Goltong Chicken where we were promptly seated and served within 10 minutes to delicious KFC.The servers are obviously extremely overwhelmed but instead of being honest with patrons (like \"hey, fried dishes will take longer than expected\") or saying they are out of items like previous reviews have mentioned, they are instead letting multiple tables walk out without their full order (without even an apology mind you).TLDR: Good drinks and instagrammable vibes but lot of tables (including our own) walked out because full orders weren\\'t received and horrible service.

Their wines range between $16-$18 by the glass, you can also get a bottle of wine to open (though there's corkage fee, this is standard).I ordered their sparkling on the menu and it was delicious, super refreshing and super unique, it was a natural wine. Everyone else at my table was pretty happy with their selections as well.-- The Food --The menu there is made for shared / family style. We ordered:- 3 Appetizers to start, they were all very delicious but the memorable ones were theCrudo with Cherries (it wasn't fishy at all, the sweetness & crunch toppings really made this special)Burrata with Tomatoes (the burrata was fluffy and a completely different texture than what I'm used to, and it was absolutely amazing. It was lightly sweetened with honey & balsamic, and the tomatoes they used were to die for).- For the greens, we ordered the Zucchini and while it was delicious, I wished we also had ordered the Little Gem Salad. If you're a veggie eater, I would recommend ordering more here- For the main, we got a single dish of the mushroom pasta. It definitely was not filling for 4 people and we should've gotten at least another 1-2 mains.Overall, it was a great experience, food was great but you'd need to order a lot to really get full. Wine selection is amazing.\"}]}\n",

Enjoyable, crispy but a little salty for my taste.Traditional Deep Dish Pizza - before I say anything else, I enjoyed this pizza. \\xa0That being said, the crust is a lot thicker than more authentic Chicago style pizzas. Often times above said crust goes toppings and cheese, then a large heaping of sauce. Given the sauce, I was most excited for this. But because the crust was so thick, I felt that the other elements were not only out of order, but lacking in amount.
