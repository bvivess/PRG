Lettuce leaves, hot peppers and ssamjang in the refrigerator. On the hot bar, they have Spicy pork with baby octopus, a spicy yam dish, fried mackerel, Korean pancake, sundubu tofu, a fluffy egg dish along with a couple other dishes I think I've missed. The cold bar had spicy crab, bean sprouts, japchae, daikon/carrots and a very nice variety of banchan. There was more that I can't remember but it was all delicious!If you're looking for super authentic homemade Korean food, this is a fantastic new option.

And they certainly did not. Everything at this place was done tastefully and elegantly. The entry way is beautifully lit with terracotta lanterns and the terrace has a beautiful classy yet warm vibe to it. This place screams pretentious but it is surprisingly not - wait staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. Now the food. Everything on the menu sounded appetizing and since there was only two of us, we couldn\\'t order too many different things. We were torn between ordering a few items to get a feel of the flavors or ordering the whole fish and just enjoying it. We went for the whole fish and we were glad we didn\\'t order anything along with it. The rockfish arrived in a tasteful stainless steel platter, and was filleted in the kitchen and sliced in the platter without losing its \"whole fish\" look. It sat on a bed of a medley of fresh salad veggies that maintained their crisp consistency despite sitting under a hot fish. Aka. They were not soggy. The seasoning of the fish was perfect, and the herbs mixed in with the spring veggies really lifted the flavors and made everything taste so light, smooth and fresh, while maintaining some richness thanks to the boldness of the olive oil in the sauce/dressing. I would highly recommend trying this place out. I\\'ll definitely be back to taste more of this gorgeous menu!'}, {'data': '2023-05-27', 'data_carrega': '2023-09-17', 'cos': 'This place is so beautiful. The vibe, service, decor, food and drinks.

Nice, clean, minimalistic/newtro aesthetic. It was also nice seeing the chefs working behind the counter rather than hidden in the back. Guy at the counter was super nice. Ordered our food, took our table number card, and found a seat immediately. It was busy but not packed. There\\'s some nice big tables in the center of the dining area which could comfortably seat 6 maybe crush in 8, and some smaller tables on the perimeter. I sat on the side that had the long bench with white stools on the other side of the table. I don\\'t recommend the white stools, my butt went numb after a while, try getting the other seats with the nicer chairs especially if you\\'re a bigger person like me.Despite the discomfort of the stool, this place gets 5 stars because the food is amazing. We had an order of three Braised Pork Belly over rice, Chiayi Chicken Rice, Egg Tart, Hong Kong Milk Tea, and later a free Pineapple Bread.Chiayi Chicken Rice was nicely seasoned. As the seasoning soaked into the rice it gave it a partial congee texture which made the meal feel very cozy (I may get this on sick days from now on). The spicy pickled radish it came with gave it a nice contrast. Add the chili sauce to every spoonful of chicken rice and it was perfection.The Braised Pork Belly over rice came a little late which is why we got our free Bread but it was worth the wait (also not docking points because it is a soft opening after all and they\\'re figuring this stuff out). Once again the seasoning was key, and the cucumber pickle perfectly cuts the greasiness of the Pork Belly. I wouldn\\'t advise everyone at the table getting this together though. My wife and I shared half and thought it would have been a bit overwhelming to deal with if one of us had our own bowl.Egg Tart was so good. It was a more custardy egg tart. Wife says the texture reminds her of a soft serve. Perfectly flaky on the outside. A+Pineapple bun... mm...mmm... chef\\'s kiss. So soft out on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. They gave us butter with the bread but honestly didn\\'t need it. \\xa0Now I\\'m glad our Pork Belly dish came out late cuz I would\\'ve missed put on my new favorite Pineapple bread.'}, {'data': '2023-08-31', 'data_carrega': '2023-09-17', 'cos': \"I'm going to be the first customer here!!!
